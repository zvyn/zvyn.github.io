================

This is the source for my github-page at zvynar.github.io.

references
----------

The following projects where very useful for this site:

* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
  for the structure and cross-browser-compatibility.
* [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery) to load subpages per AJAX in a
  very simple way.
* [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to generate a static version from
  the same source that is used for AJAX-requests. I decided to use Jekyll
  because it is run by github automatically.

license
-------

See LICENSE.md. In short: do not republish the imprint or photos showing my face
but feel free to use the rest as you want under the license form HTML5 Boilerplate.
